Description: An R package for retrieving window-span collocates of a (set of) nodeword(s) from raw/untagged text corpora.
    The current functionality deals with the sentence-based, corpus-input from the Indonesian Leipzig Corpora.
    There are also functions to determine mutual association strength between a node-word/search pattern and its window-span collocates.
    The currently available association measures are the Simple Collocates Analysis and Distinctive Collocates Analysis.
    The association measure computations can be based on the log-transformed p-value of the one-tailed Fisher-Yates Exact test, Chi-Square test, and Log-Likelihood Ratio.
