Description: A tool for generating and analysing window-span collocates of a (set of) node-word(s) from raw text corpora.
    The current functionality deals with the sentence-based corpus-input from the Indonesian Leipzig Corpora.
    There are also functions to determine mutual association strength between a node-word/search pattern and its window-span collocates.
    The currently available association measures are the Simple Collocates Analysis and Distinctive Collocates Analysis.
    These measures are based on the log-transformed p-value of the one-tailed Fisher-Yates Exact test.
